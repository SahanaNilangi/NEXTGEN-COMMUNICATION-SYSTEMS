# Wireless Notice Board
## Project Description
This project aims to design and implement a wireless notice board using simple and readily available components: an Arduino Uno, a Bluetooth module HC-05, a 16x2 LCD display, jumper wires, a 1k ohm resistor, and a breadboard. With the help of the wireless notice board, messages may be shown remotely over Bluetooth, providing quick updates without requiring users to physically interact with the board. This initiative can be especially helpful in workplaces, public spaces, and educational institutions where prompt and adaptable communication is essential. Through the use of Bluetooth technology, this system offers a practical and affordable answer to contemporary communication needs.

## Installation Instructions
